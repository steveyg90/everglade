A game by Ste and Jay.

“It is better to be a warrior in a garden than a gardener in a war.”

Project Started 25th November 2019. Moved into office 5th December 2019.

Rough premise...

You are a pilot on the mining vessel ESS Snowdon, surveying sector 327 scanning for cobalt reserves. Only 3 more weeks until you return home. Disaster strikes, crash, bang wallop, you get struck by a rogue meteor and plummet to the unknown planet  below. When you wake up and crawl from the smoking wreckage you hear the Snowdon on your intercom...
Something like that as a rough premise, you get your stuff sent down from the Snowdon, it comes crashing down from the sky and builds itself on the surface, you are trying to get back..
